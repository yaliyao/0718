Set Raspberry Pi 3 as an Eddystone URL beacon

1) Check bluetooth device
   hciconfig -a
   
2) Enable the Bluetooth device
   hciconfig hci0 up
   
3) Set the Bluetooth device to “advertise and not-connectable”
   hciconfig hci0 leadv 3
   
4) Enter the Beacon Advertising Data
   hcitool -i hci0 cmd 0x08 0x0008 17 02 01 06 03 03 aa fe 0f 16 aa fe 10 00 03 77 65 62 67 61 7a 65 72 08 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 (https://webgazer.org)
   hcitool -i hci0 cmd 0x08 0x0008 15 02 01 06 03 03 aa fe 0d 16 aa fe 10 00 01 67 6f 6f 67 6c 65 07 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 (https://www.google.com)
   
   
   Option	Description

   aa	    16-bit Eddystone UUID
   fe	    16-bit Eddystone UUID
   0f	    Length. The hexadecimal 0f converts to 15 decimal which is the number of bytes that follow
   16	    Service Data data type value
   aa	    16-bit Eddystone UUID
   fe	    16-bit Eddystone UUID
   10	    Frame Type = URL
   00	    TX Power (this should be calibrated)
   02       changed to 03

   URL Scheme (http:// = 0x02)(https:// = 0x03). See 2016-13-09 edit comments.

5) If you want to advertize a different URL enter the URL of the link that you want to advertize in the link below

6) To detect the Raspberry Pi beacon with an iPhone follow the steps in the video below which outlines how to enable Chrome’s Physical Web extension 
   On iOS 
   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxPcPXSE_O0

   On Android, your phone should detect the URL if you have Android 4.3.2 or higher with bluetooth turned on, location turned on, 
   and Chrome location runtime permission turned on. 
   https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/6239299?hl=en. 
   However, I had to install the Physical Web App from https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=physical_web.org.physicalweb&hl=en to make it work.


As pointed out in the comments, Google made a change so as to require https in order for chrome to detect the URL Beacon. So in order to fix a change was made in the URL Scheme from http:// = 0x02 to https:// = 0x03.
